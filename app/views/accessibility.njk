            navigate most of the website using speech recognition software

            listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS) 
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non-accessible content</h1>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>
            there's no way to skip the repeated content in the page header (for example, a ‘skip to main content' option)
          </li>
          <li>
            it's not always possible to change the device orientation from horizontal to vertical without making it more difficult to view the content
